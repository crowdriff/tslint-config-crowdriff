### CrowdRiff ts-linter config!

## What should we do

```
yarn add tslint-config-crowdriff
```
Ensure that tslint and typescript are installed as dependencies (this config needs them as peer dependencies)

To get autosaving working, add the tslint extension to vscode and in settings, set `eslint.autoFixOnSave: true`.
